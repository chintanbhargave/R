You have been supplied with data for 2 years: 1960 and 2013 and you are required to produce a visualisation for each of these years.

Some data has been provided in a data.csv file and  vector.R file containing vectors. The csv file contains combined data for both years. All data manipulations have to be performed in R (not in excel) because this project may be audited at a later stage.
