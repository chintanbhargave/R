The purpose of this is exercise is to test the Law of Large Numbers. 
The Law of Large Numbers : The average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value and will tend to become closer to the expected value as more trials are performed.

Problem Statement :

Test the law of large numbers for N random normally distributed numbers with mean =0, std dev =1.

Create a R script that will count how many of these numbers fall between -1 and 1 and divide by the total of N.

You know that E(X) = 68.2%

Check that Mean (Xn) -> E(X) as you rerun the script while increasing N.
